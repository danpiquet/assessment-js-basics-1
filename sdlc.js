// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Development ------- I added this stage to your list and created a variable to explain it. Hopefully that is ok. It was missing from the original list.
// Testing & Integration
// Implementation
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = "This is the stage where a specific details and requirements for a new system are gathered. System requirements are defined from software, hardware, and network points of view and gathered together to present an accurate depiction of the intended system, including angles from the time-management and funding perspectives."
const design = "Design is a precursor to development. This step requires the development team to outline details for the application such as user interface, system interface, network, and database requirements. The design stage produces a reference document that can later be implemented into a programming language."
const development = "The rubber meets the road as the outline of the design is converted into a functional program. Developers follow the instructions and guides set up in the previous steps to flesh out the application. Developers are also required to choose which programming languages to use for the different pieces of the development."
const testing = "The testing phase requires developers, designers, and QA to find, note, track, and fix any bugs that may exist in the application -- which could include hardware, software, integration, systems, etc... -- anything in the full system."
const implementation = "Once tested thoroughly, modules and designs are integrated into the primary source code. At this stage, training environments are used to detect further errors and defects"
const maintenance = "When the system reaches the market, developers are still responsible for monitoring residual bugs reported by end-users or implementing additional changes to the software."
